# PongGame

A simple pong game tutorial to introduce Python to beginner programmers. This tutorial is adapted from the Python Learning series on freeCodeCamp.org. The intro to the python syntactical section was adapted from [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp). It is a brilliant resource for further reading in Python and a myriad of other programming languages and concepts.

## Install Python

PackHacks Hacker Guide: [How to install Python](https://www.notion.so/Hacker-Resources-cb0b84f22831494fb174571c065f502c#03d184ea17834231b0cc88b834352b0a)

## Install a Text Editor

Although any text editor will technically work, I'd recommend one that has some tools to help us write python.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an open-source code editor created by Microsoft.
It's the editor I use throughout the tutorial.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) is a free and open-source text editor developed by GitHub.
You can install a package like [atom-beaufity](https://atom.io/packages/atom-beautify) to help format your code.
